# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-
This is a classic computer science project from the 70"s for a cellular automaton. 
The Game of Life is a zero-player game devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game
is determined by the initial state, requiring no further input.


## Game Rules 

1.  If a cell is "alive" and has 2-3 neighbors it remains alive. Else it dies.
2. If a cell is "dead" and has exactly 3 neighbors, then it comes to life. Else it dies.
