# how to start this project?
# what language am I gonna use ?
im sticking with javascript and react 
got styling done 
# research how to get the cells working?
# research the game of life 
The game of life is a zero player game devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
One interacts with the game of life by creating an initial configuration and obsevering how it evolves.

# what are the rules for Conways game of life?

The universe of game of life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
there are two possible states live or dead 
every cell interacts with its neigbours, which are the cells that are directly, horizontally, or diagnolly adjacent. At each step in time the following transitions occur.
1. any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies(referred to as underpopulation or exposure)
2. any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies .
3. any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged to the nect generation.
4. any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life 



# what is a cellular automita and how are they useful in real life?
A cellular automaton is a dicrete model of computatuon.
A certian class of mathematical objects.
a cuellular automton consists of 
- A space of cells.
- A set of allowed states for each cell. An assignment of an state to every cell is called a “configuration” or “pattern” (the first term is more common in mathematical discussion and the later in informal discussions).
- A neighbourhood which defines which cells are considered to pass information to a given cell.
- A transition rule which specifies how given a cell and the states of its neighbours, a new state is produced.

They are used in

Physical systems: One of their applications is description of recrystallization in certain types of metals an alloys. They describe dendrites during crystallization.
Description of Percolation within structures.
Cracks propagation within materials.
Laser behaviour is modeled.
Avalanches. Think about Per Bak sand pile models.
Traffic flow on highways and within cities.
Description of Flood propagation within the country.
Biology to model ecosystems
Chemistry: chemical and biochemical reactions.
Medicine, cellular automata model spread of diseases.
Coding messages by cellular automata, which produce very strong codes.
Picture compression gives very good results.
# what is touring completeness ?
A computational system that can compute every turing-computable function 
In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete. The concept is named after English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing.
# what is double buffing ?
Double buffering is a term used to describe a device that has two buffers. The usage of multiple buffers increases the overall throughput of a device and helps prevents bottlenecks. For example, with graphics, double buffering can show one image or frame while a separate frame is being buffered to be shown next. This method makes animations and games look more realistic than the same done in a single buffer mode.
